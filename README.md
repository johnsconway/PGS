# PGS
PGS - Pretty Good Simulation for collider physics events.

In this repositry you will find the tar.gz files for the PGS package.  Each version is called PGS-yymmdd according to the date of release.  They unroll to a directory called PGS, so be careful about overwriting earlier versions in your area.

There is limited documentation on PGS, which is now maintained mainly for historical reasons.  For a modern collider detector simulation, you should probably be using DELPHES.

Please do not hesitate to contact John Conway at conway@physics.ucdavis.edu if you have any questions.
